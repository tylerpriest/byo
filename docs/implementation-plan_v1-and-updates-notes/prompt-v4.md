## 2. Architecture & Development Principles

### Code Organization
- **Feature-based structure** in `/src/features/`
- Organize by feature, not by file type
- Keep related code together (components, hooks, types, tests)
- Co-locate tests with source code

### DRY Principles (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Never reinvent the wheel**
- Use Supabase built-in Auth (don't build custom)
- Use ShadCN blocks and templates (dashboard, auth, landing)
- Share components across features
- Leverage existing battle-tested solutions

### TDD Strategy (Test-Driven Development)
- **TDD-enforced for critical paths:**
  - Authentication: >80% coverage
  - Authorization (RBAC): >80% coverage
  - Payment processing: >80% coverage
  - Admin functions: >80% coverage
- **TDD-ready for everything else:**
  - Business logic: 30% coverage target
  - UI components: Test key interactions
  - Utilities: Test edge cases
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Block commits below coverage thresholds

### Graceful Degradation Pattern
**Philosophy:** Fail-safe, not fail-hard
- System continues with reduced functionality when services unavailable
- Clear communication to users (banners, toasts)
- Never crash on missing config or service failures
- **Examples:**
  - Missing Supabase credentials → Auto demo mode
  - Payment service down → Cache + retry queue
  - Email service down → Log + manual review

### Demo Mode System (3-Tier Hierarchy)
1. **Admin Dashboard Toggle** (highest priority)
   - Runtime control via `system_settings` table
   - Override environment variables
   - Instant enable/disable across entire platform
2. **Environment Variable** (`VITE_DEMO_MODE=true`)
   - Development/staging environments
   - Preview deployments
   - Local testing
3. **Auto-Fallback** (lowest priority)
   - Missing `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` or `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Automatic mock client activation
   - Zero-config quick start for demos

**Demo Mode Features:**
- Mock Supabase client with realistic data
- Demo login button (one-click access)
- DemoModeBanner component (dismissible warning)
- Console warnings (not errors)
- Fully functional app with simulated backend

**Platform Admin Demo Mode:**
- **Platform admins MUST be able to login during demo mode**
- Mock data includes platform admin role for demo user
- Prevents admin lock-out scenario (can't disable demo mode if locked out)
- **Quick demo login buttons on ALL login pages:**
  - `/login` - Regular user demo login
  - `/admin/login` - Platform admin demo login
- Mock `system_roles` table includes: `demo-user-123` → `platform_admin`
- Ensures admins can test platform features in demo mode

### Project Creation
- **Build from scratch** - Don't use existing boilerplates from GitHub
- Understand every piece of the architecture
- Full control and customization
- Learn by building, not by copying

## 4. UI/UX Principles

### User Experience
- **Optimistic UI** - Update UI immediately, sync in background
  - Show success state instantly
  - Rollback gracefully on error
  - Display subtle syncing indicator
- **Fail Gracefully** - Never crash, always provide feedback
  - Meaningful error messages
  - Actionable recovery steps
  - Fallback content when data unavailable
- **Loading States** - Skeleton screens, spinners, progress bars
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first, tablet, desktop breakpoints

### Component Strategy
- **Use ShadCN components as much as possible**
- Start with ShadCN blocks (pre-built compositions)
- Customize when necessary (theming, variants)
- Maintain consistent design language
- Accessibility built-in (ARIA, keyboard nav)

---

## 5. Documentation Strategy

### Documentation Philosophy
- **Documentation as Code** - Version controlled, lives with codebase
- **Progressive Disclosure** - README → CLAUDE.md → detailed docs
- **Living Documentation** - Update docs with code changes
- **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** - One canonical location per topic

### Documentation Structure
```
/docs/
  /documentation/       # Core technical docs
    architecture.md
    auth.md
    rbac.md
    multi-tenancy.md
    testing.md
    deployment.md
    setup.md
  /specs/              # Technical specifications
    database-schema.md
    rbac-spec.md
    api-spec.md
  /tasks/              # Task management
    /active/           # In progress
    /complete/         # Finished
    /template/         # Templates
    /draft/            # Planned
```

### Documentation Rules
- **Allowed in root (5 files only):**
  1. `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
  2. `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant context
  3. `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
  4. `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and release notes
  5. `LICENSE` - Project license
- **All other docs go in `/docs/`** - No exceptions
- **Before creating ANY document:**
  1. Can I update an existing doc? → Update, don't create
  2. Is this SSOT? → Make it canonical
  3. Belongs in root? → Check the 5 allowed files list
  4. What's the lifecycle? → Place in appropriate subdirectory
- **Keep docs clean and organized** - Easy navigation, searchable

### Session Notes
- **Document build conversations in `/docs/notes.md`**
- Record any additions or changes beyond the original prompt
- Track user requests and decisions made during implementation
- Note deviations from the plan with rationale
- Include timestamps and context for future reference
- Use as a living log of the project's evolution

## 6. Testing & CI/CD

### Testing Strategy

**Coverage Requirements:**
- **Critical Paths (>80% coverage, enforced):**
  - Authentication flows
  - Authorization (RBAC, RLS policies)
  - Payment processing
  - Admin functions (user management, role assignment)
- **Standard Features (30% coverage, target):**
  - Business logic
  - Form validation
  - Utility functions
- **Optional (test when valuable):**
  - Simple UI components
  - Configuration files
  - Prototypes and spikes

**Test Types:**
- **Unit Tests** - Vitest, co-located with source
- **Integration Tests** - Multi-component interactions
- **E2E Tests** - Playwright, user workflows
- **Smoke Tests** - White screen detection, critical paths
- **Type Tests** - TypeScript compilation, Vitest type testing

**Pre-Commit Hooks (Husky):**
- Run tests, block if coverage drops below thresholds
- Lint and format code
- Type checking
- Commit message validation (conventional commits)

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**On Pull Request:**
- Lint (ESLint)
- Type check (TypeScript)
- Unit tests (Vitest)
- E2E tests (Playwright)
- Coverage report (comment on PR)
- Build verification

**On Merge to Main:**
- All PR checks
- Deploy to Vercel (production)
- Supabase migrations (if any)
- Type generation (`database.types.ts`)
- Smoke tests on production

**Deployment Verification:**
- White screen detection
- Critical user flows working
- Console error monitoring
- Performance metrics baseline

### Playwright Configuration
- **List mode** and **headless mode** for CI
- **Head mode** for local debugging
- Visual automation without full screen takeover
- MCP integration for AI-assisted test generation

### End-of-Build Validation
Before considering the build complete, run through this checklist:

**Required Checks:**
- ✅ **Full test suite passes** - `npm test` (all unit + integration tests)
- ✅ **White screen detection** - Smoke tests verify key pages render
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation** - `npm run type-check` or `tsc --noEmit` (zero errors)
- ✅ **ESLint validation** - `npm run lint` (zero errors, warnings acceptable)
- ✅ **Production build succeeds** - `npm run build` (no build errors)
- ✅ **No console errors** - Check key pages (landing, login, dashboard, admin) for console errors
- ✅ **Demo mode works** - Test auto-fallback, demo login buttons, admin demo access
- ✅ **Real mode works** - Test with actual Supabase credentials

**Optional but Recommended:**
- Preview deployment works (Vercel preview URL)
- E2E tests pass (`npm run test:e2e`)
- Database migrations apply cleanly
- All environment variables documented

**If anything fails:**
- Document the issue in `/docs/notes.md`
- Include error messages and context
- Note if it's blocking or can be fixed later

## 7. Philosophy & Constraints

### Never Reinvent the Wheel
- **If Supabase offers it, use it:**
  - Authentication → Supabase Auth
  - Database → PostgreSQL with RLS
  - Storage → Supabase Storage
  - Realtime → Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- **If ShadCN has it, use it:**
  - Dashboard → `dashboard` block
  - Sidebar → `sidebar` block
  - Auth → `login` block
  - Forms → Pre-built form components
- **If it's battle-tested, leverage it:**
  - Logging → Pino
  - Validation → Zod
  - Forms → react-hook-form
  - Testing → Vitest + Playwright

**Reference Official Guides:**
- **Supabase Multi-Tenancy:** https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#multi-tenancy
- Follow official patterns and best practices when available
- Use documented approaches over custom solutions
- Check official docs before implementing complex features

### Build Fresh (Don't Use Boilerplates)
- **Create this project from scratch**
- No GitHub boilerplates (e.g., vite-react-ts-shadcn-ui)
- Understand every line of code
- Full control over architecture
- Learn patterns, don't copy-paste

### MCP-First Development
- **Install 5 mandatory MCPs early** (Phase 0 or Phase 1)
- Authenticate with services (GitHub, Vercel, Supabase)
- Use MCPs for repetitive tasks:
  - ShadCN MCP for component generation
  - GitHub MCP for PR creation
  - Vercel MCP for deployment
  - Supabase MCP for migrations
  - Playwright MCP for test generation
- **Human input required:** MCP authentication, OAuth approvals

### Graceful Degradation Everywhere
- **Apply the demo mode pattern to all external services:**
  - Supabase → Mock client (implemented)
  - Stripe → Mock payment processor (future)
  - SendGrid → Mock email service (future)
  - S3/Storage → Mock file storage (future)
  - Analytics → Mock tracking (future)
- **Benefits:**
  - Zero-config quick start
  - Demo environments without real services
  - Development without production credentials
  - Testing without external dependencies

### AI-Native Workflow
**Development Flow:**
```
Human: Write spec → Create draft task
  ↓
AI: Read spec + plan + code → Implement + Test + Document
  ↓
Human: Review code + security + business logic
  ↓
Human: Merge → AI archives task
```

**Human focuses on:**
- Requirements and specifications
- Business logic validation
- Security review
- Strategic decisions
- User experience

**AI focuses on:**
- Implementation
- Test writing
- Documentation updates
- Repetitive tasks
- Pattern application

### Getting Started
Give this prompt to Claude Code in plan mode. Claude will:
1. Set up MCP ecosystem
2. Initialize project with latest versions
3. Implement features based on this spec
4. Create tests and documentation
5. Configure CI/CD
6. Deploy to Vercel

### Implementation Tracking
Let Claude Code decide the implementation phases and order based on dependencies and best practices.

The project uses a phased implementation approach with status tracking:

**Phase States:**
1. **📋 Not Started** - Phase has not begun
2. **🔄 In Progress** - Actively working on phase tasks
3. **✅ Implementation Complete** - All tasks finished, awaiting validation
4. **🎯 Tested & Validated** - All success criteria met, phase complete

**Implementation Plan Location:** `/docs/implementation-plan.md`

The implementation plan contains:
- Master status tracking table at the top (single source of truth)
- Detailed tasks, dependencies, and success criteria for each phase
- Testing requirements and deliverables
- Timeline estimates and human review points

**Update the status table** in the implementation plan as you progress through phases. Add notes for blockers, decisions, or important context in the Notes column.

**This is a template.** Customize the business logic in the dashboard and build your unique SaaS product on this solid foundation.
